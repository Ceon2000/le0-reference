  "Analyze the scoring logic in the codebase. Identify how different ticket attributes contribute to priority scores and verify the normalization calculations are correct.",
  "Review the routing rules implementation. Examine how tickets are assigned to different queues based on category, priority, and other factors.",
  "Evaluate the validation coverage across the codebase. Check which input fields are validated and identify any missing validation checks.",
  "Investigate configuration precedence handling. Determine how environment variables, config files, and default values interact when settings conflict.",
  "Examine the storage layer behavior. Analyze how data persistence works across different storage backends and identify potential consistency issues.",
  "Assess test coverage gaps. Review the test suite and identify areas where critical functionality lacks adequate test coverage.",
  "Verify documentation accuracy. Compare the documented API behavior with the actual implementation to find discrepancies.",
  "Analyze edge case handling. Identify scenarios where the system might fail or behave unexpectedly under unusual input conditions.",
  "Review refactoring opportunities. Examine code duplication, complexity hotspots, and areas that would benefit from structural improvements.",
  "Evaluate error handling patterns. Check how exceptions are caught, logged, and propagated throughout the system.",
  "Examine data model relationships. Verify that entity relationships are correctly defined and enforced across the codebase.",
  "Analyze performance bottlenecks. Identify operations that might become slow under high load or with large datasets.",
  "Review security considerations. Check for potential vulnerabilities in input handling, authentication, and authorization logic.",
  "Examine logging and observability. Evaluate how system events are tracked and whether sufficient context is captured for debugging.",
  "Assess code maintainability. Evaluate naming conventions, code organization, and adherence to established patterns.",
  "Review integration points. Examine how different modules interact and identify potential coupling issues.",
  "Analyze resource management. Check for proper cleanup of connections, file handles, and other system resources.",
  "Evaluate concurrency handling. Examine how the system handles concurrent requests and potential race conditions.",
  "Review data transformation logic. Verify that data conversions and normalizations preserve correctness across different formats.",
  "Examine dependency management. Check for outdated dependencies, version conflicts, and potential security vulnerabilities.",
  "Analyze business logic correctness. Verify that core algorithms implement the intended behavior without off-by-one errors or logic flaws.",
  "Review API contract compliance. Ensure that public interfaces match their documented specifications and handle edge cases gracefully.",
  "Examine state management. Analyze how application state is maintained and identify potential inconsistencies or race conditions.",
  "Evaluate scalability considerations. Identify components that might not scale well as usage increases or data volumes grow.",
  "Review code quality metrics. Assess complexity, testability, and adherence to best practices across different modules."
